### 🧭 Who Am I?

I'm NithishKumar, a full-stack web developer from India. I specialize in building functional and user-friendly web applications. With a passion for both backend logic and frontend design, I strive to create seamless and efficient digital solutions.

Currently, I'm focused on projects in the bidding, e-commerce, and wholesale domains, and I'm always eager to learn and grow as a developer.

### 💡 Current Mission: *"Build a smarter bidding ecosystem."*

💼 I'm building a full-featured **bidding platform** focused on bulk wholesale products, where sellers, users, and admins operate seamlessly. Real-time features, secure bidding, and intuitive design—crafted from scratch.

📅 Schdulo — A dynamic scheduling web app aimed at optimizing time management, task assignment, and calendar coordination across teams.
