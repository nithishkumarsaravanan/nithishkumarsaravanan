### 🧭 Who Am I?

I'm **Nithishkumar**, a full-stack web developer from India, crafting functional and purpose-driven web apps. I love exploring the deeper side of backend development—where logic lives—and bringing interfaces to life on the frontend.  
Beyond just shipping code, I believe in designing digital tools that solve real-world problems, especially in the domain of **bidding, e-commerce**, and **wholesale platforms**.

### 💡 Current Mission: *"Build a smarter bidding ecosystem."*

💼 I'm building a full-featured **bidding platform** focused on bulk wholesale products, where sellers, users, and admins operate seamlessly. Real-time features, secure bidding, and intuitive design—crafted from scratch.

📅 Schdulo — A dynamic scheduling web app aimed at optimizing time management, task assignment, and calendar coordination across teams.
